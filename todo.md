# Initial prompt

Please thoroughly read the entirety of CONTRIBUTING.md and INSTRUCTION.md,
(CONTRIBUTING.md is really long, so you might need to split it up and read it carefully over multiple sessions.)

and perfectly and more improvely implement everything outlined in CONTRIBUTING.md to bring the naikit(main folder) project to a production-ready level.

(Don‚Äôt forget one of the key points: you need to use the 'axion-state' library to handle the state management. You can find how to use this library by carefully checking the README.md at (axion folder) or even digging into the code itself to uncover features that might not be mentioned in the README.md. digging into the axion code yourself to check it all out.)

When you finish your each tasks, please review with paranoid, obsessive, and perfectionist scrutiny whether every single feature and design outlined in CONTRIBUTING.md has been fully implemented in every aspect in a (todo.md). You can check if your nai original site DOM selector works see the nai_site_reference.html

Since you have not enough context length limit, every task must be done by smartest way.

You always prevent potential issues in advance through type checking, testing, and linting. Additionally, you create a (todo.md) file each time to outline your plans, updating its contents consistently to maintain direction. While the direction may shift midway, you must remain aware at every moment of whether those changes are truly necessary, approaching the task with the responsibility of a top team leader in a large corporation‚Äôs development team.

- React 18
- Axion for state management
- Vite 4.3+ with @samrum/vite-plugin-web-extension
- Bun 1.0+ as package manager
- Tailwind CSS 3.3+
- TipTap/ProseMirror for rich text editing

### Segment Visualization Implementation

#### Component Architecture
- BaseSegment: Core component with selection and common functionality
- TextSegment: For basic text content
- WeightedSegment: For text with emphasis/de-emphasis weight
- PresetSegment: For wildcards and keywords
- InlineWildcardSegment: For inline option lists

- Perfect synchronization with NovelAI (no drift between systems)
- High test coverage (95%+ for core logic, 80%+ overall)

## UI Component Implementation Plan

### 1. Sidebar Container

The sidebar container will be the main UI element that hosts all NaiKit functionality. It should:

- Appear on the left side of the NovelAI interface
- Be resizable with a drag handle
- Be collapsible via a toggle button
- Have a clean, minimal design that integrates with NovelAI's aesthetic
- Contain sections for main prompts, character prompts, and settings

**Component Structure:**

- `SidebarContainer`: Main wrapper with positioning and sizing
- `SidebarHeader`: Contains title, mode tabs, and collapse button
- `SidebarContent`: Scrollable content area for all sections
- `SidebarResizeHandle`: Handle for adjusting width
- `SidebarFooter`: Contains generation controls and status information

### 2. Mode Switching System

The mode switching system will allow users to toggle between Compose and Fine-tune modes:

- Two clearly labeled tabs at the top of the sidebar
- Visual indication of current mode
- Smooth transition between modes
- Preservation of state when switching modes

**Component Structure:**

- `ModeTabs`: Container for the mode selection tabs
- `ModeTab`: Individual tab component with active state
- `ModeContext`: React context for accessing current mode throughout the app

### 3. Segment Visualization Components

These components will render different segment types with appropriate visualizations:

- `TextSegment`: Plain text rendering
- `WeightedSegment`: Text with weight indicator and color coding
- `PresetSegment`: Special visualization for wildcards/keywords
- `InlineWildcardSegment`: Options list with selection UI

Each component should:

- Render differently based on the current mode
- Support selection and focused states
- Include appropriate interaction handlers
- Be optimized for performance when many segments are rendered

### 4. Prompt Editor

The editor will be based on TipTap/ProseMirror and provide a rich editing experience:

- Custom nodes for each segment type
- Context menu for segment operations
- Keyboard shortcuts for common actions
- Real-time synchronization with segment state
- Support for both text input and drag/drop operations

**Component Structure:**

- `PromptEditor`: Main editor component with TipTap integration
- `EditorToolbar`: Format and segment controls
- `ContextMenu`: Right-click menu for segment actions
- `SuggestionDropdown`: For preset/wildcard autocompletion

### 5. Weight Adjustment Interface

The weight interface will appear in Fine-tune mode and allow precise control:

- Slider for weight adjustment with bracket level visualization
- Color-coded weight indicators (blue for increase, red for decrease)
- Numerical input for precise values
- Group management controls

**Component Structure:**

- `WeightSlider`: Interactive slider for weight adjustment
- `WeightIndicator`: Visual display of current weight
- `BracketLevelDisplay`: Shows bracketing level in NovelAI format
- `GroupControls`: Interface for creating and managing groups
